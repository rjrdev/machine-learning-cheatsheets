# Cheatsheets

## Purpose
A collection of high-level cheatsheets of common Pyhthon Machine Learning libraries
* numpy
* Pandas
* matplotlib + Seaborn
* TensorFlow + Keras

## Table of Contents
|Cheatsheet|Link|
---|---
|1 - numpy 🔢🥧|[1_numpy.ipynb](1_numpy.ipynb)|
|2 - Pandas 🐼|[2_pandas.ipynb](2_pandas.ipynb)|
|3 - matplotlib 📊 + Seaborn 🌊|[3_matplotlib_seaborn.ipynb](2_pandas.ipynb)|
|4 - TensorFlow 🧠 + Keras 🤖|[4_tf_keras.ipynb](4_tf_keras.ipynb)|

## Suggestions?
Any ideas on how to improve these cheatsheets? Want to contribute and add a new cheatsheet for another Python Machine Learning technology or library?

Create a PR and I'll review with feedback and possibly merge into the codebase.
